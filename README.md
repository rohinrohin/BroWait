*Intelligently predicts whether a wait-listed train-ticket will be confirmed or now before you book it.*


BroWait uses an extension for Google Chrome that gives a non intrusive
interface for users so they can intelligently know whether a
wait-listed train will eventually be confirmed or not before you even
book a ticket. The chrome extension will automatically scrape the
IRCTC website, to seamlessly display realtime information injected
into the website.

**The Problem:**  
The Indian government makes over 700 crores every year in cancellation
fees. This is due to the immense number of people who book train seats
who eventually do not end up travelling due to unavailability of
seats, and cancel their reservation.

Our objective is to allow people to make intelligent decisions before
buying the tickets.
